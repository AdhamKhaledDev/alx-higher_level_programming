This project delves into the world of databases and Python by demonstrating two approaches for interacting with a MySQL database:

    Direct SQL Queries: We'll utilize the MySQLdb library to connect to the database and execute SQL commands directly.
    Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with SQLAlchemy: We'll then explore SQLAlchemy, an ORM that simplifies database interaction. With SQLAlchemy, you focus on objects representing your data, and it handles the underlying SQL communication.
